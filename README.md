A WordPress plugin for Attach embeds

https://cs.wordpress.org/plugins/attach-embeds/

## Versioning

We use CI, which is not compatible with semantic versioning. Semantic version numbers are injected during build. DO NOT update the `0.0.0` version number in files.

The plugin version will be replaced with this:

```
{major}.{milestone}.{release-timestamp}[-{hofix-timestamp}-hotfix-name]
```

Example:

```
1.4.1568065332-1568065333-hotfix
```
